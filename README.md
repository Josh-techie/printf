# Project #0x11 - C printf

This project is part of the **ALX Software engineering curriculum** undertaken by our team. Our goal was to replicate the functionality of the `printf()` function from the C standard library using our own version of the same.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, we sought to gain knowledge and experience in several areas, including:

* Using git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a large-scale project
* Managing many files and finding an efficient workflow
* Dealing with the complexities of `printf()`

## Technologies Used

To complete this project, we used the following technologies and tools:

* C programming language
* Git version control system

## Team Members

The following individuals were members of the team who completed this project:

* [Josh-Techie](https://github.com/Josh-techie)
* [Soufiane-Oumalek](https://github.com/soufiane-oumalek)

## How to Use

To use our implementation of `printf()` in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the `holberton.h` header file in your source code.
3. Call the `_printf()` function in your code as needed.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the instructors and staff at ALX for providing us with the opportunity to undertake this project and develop our skills as software engineers.

## Note
Because the other member was let go from the program and had deleted the repo, since we had it in his workplace, I had to push from my local and push the final project under my name.
